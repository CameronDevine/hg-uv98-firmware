LANCHONLH HG-UV98 APRS Dual Band Firmware

I requested this firmware to Wuxi Venus Information Technology Co., Ltd and they kindly sent it to me compressed in a .rar file with no license attached.

I asked for permission to modify and distribute it and was told:

So, given that there's no license directly attached but we have permission to moodify and distribute the code, I think BSD-3c is appropriate, but please beware that we haven't been given an explicit license to use.
